========

A multi-coin wallet that supports trustless cross-chain trading.

## Download

We recommend having [Java 8](http://www.oracle.com/technetwork/java/javase/downloads/jre8-downloads-2133155.html) installed.

* [Windows (.exe)](https://github.com/mappum/mercury/releases/download/0.0.1-alpha/MercuryWallet-0.0.1-SNAPSHOT.exe)
* [OSX (.dmg)](https://github.com/mappum/mercury/releases/download/0.0.1-alpha/MercuryWallet-0.0.1-SNAPSHOT.dmg)
* [Linux (.jar)](https://github.com/mappum/mercury/releases/download/0.0.1-alpha/MercuryWallet-0.0.1-SNAPSHOT.jar)

## Build

You might want to build Mercury if you don't want to trust a pre-built binary, or you are making changes to the code.

Required:

* [JDK 8](http://www.oracle.com/technetwork/java/javase/downloads/jdk8-downloads-2133151.html)
* [Maven 3](http://maven.apache.org/download.cgi)

Clone the project and build it:
```
$ git clone https://github.com/mappum/mercury
$ cd mercury
$ mvn clean install
```
This will create the files you want to run in a directory called `target`. There will be a `.jar`, `.exe`, and on OSX a `.app` and `.dmg`.

## Contributing

Mercury is in need of testing and code contributions. Please feel free to file issues if you find any bugs. 

If any critical exploits are found in the cross-chain atomic swap implementation, we will gladly pay bounties if they are disclosed responsibly (there is bound to be some low-hanging fruit to find). [There will be a Crowdcurity link here shortly].
